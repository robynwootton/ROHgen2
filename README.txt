Comments on analysis plan, phenotyping etc
- We have supplied heart rate measures taken from seated. 
- We removed sex as a covariate because the sample is all female
- We included the variable ‘number ever born’ but please be aware ALSPAC is a birth cohort and mothers were recruited during pregnancy
- We removed the analyses ‘neb_men’ and ‘afb_men’ because the sample was all female
- The expected mean haemoglobin level was adjusted to 13.09 g/dL because the sample was all female. 
- CRP levels were left in for analysis but please note that anti-inflammatory drug status was not available as a covariate.
